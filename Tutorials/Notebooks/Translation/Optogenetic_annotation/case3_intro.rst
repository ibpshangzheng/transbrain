Introduction
--------------------

- Optogenetic fMRI provides detailed maps of whole-brain responses to circuit-specific manipulations in mice (`ref <https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(24)00043-6>`_), yet translating these findings into human behavioral contexts remains challenging.

- Conversely, human task-fMRI has identified robust task-related activation patterns linked to specific cognitive and behavioral states (`ref <https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(24)00043-6>`_), but lacks causal circuit-level evidence.

- In this tutorial, you can learn how to use TransBrain to bridge this translational gap by mapping optogenetically-driven circuit patterns into human brain space and linking optogenetic findings with established human cognitive maps.
