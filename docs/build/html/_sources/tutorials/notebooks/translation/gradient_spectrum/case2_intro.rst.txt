Introduction
--------------------

- The fundamental architecture of brain function, particularly during resting states, has been extensively characterized in both humans and mice through multiple analytical frameworks, which help enhance our understanding of fundamental brain architecture and provide valuable frameworks for investigating cognitive processes and psychiatric disorders. (`ref1 <https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1608282113>`_ and `ref2 <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811915011301>`_)

- Here, we applied TransBrain to systematically assess the cross-species correspondence in resting-state brain organization across these functional features.

- Please refer to the **Methods** section of our `paper <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.27.635016v2.abstract>`_ for detailed preprocessing and computing procedures.


Data
--------------------

- The resting-state fMRI data were obtained from the `HCP Young Adult 1200 Subjects Data Release <https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/data-releases>`_.

- The resting-state fMRI data for awake mice we used can be downloaded from `this link <https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/np2fx99hn6/2/>`_.

- Pre-saved human and mouse functional gradients are available `here <https://github.com/ibpshangzheng/transbrain/tree/main/tutorials/notebooks/translation/gradient_spectrum>`_.
